<h3>Steps taken to create design</h3>
<p>I used PixelLab software to create the flyer design for the hair salon.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I downloaded free images from <a href="https://www.citypng.com">citypng</a>.</li>
    <li>After downloading the pictures, I uploaded them to another website to remove their original background <a href="https://remove.bg">here</a>.</li>
    <li>I created a blank environment on PixelLab and inserted the business title and motto.The font size was set at 48, font was 'Chunkfive' for the title whereas the motto had font size of 23 and 'ABeeZee-Regular' was the font type used.</li>
    <li>I created an orange background colour around the motto. Left padding was -1 and right padding, -3. </li>
    <li>I inputed the images of braids with sizes of 17% for width and 16% for height.</li>
    <li>I added a semicircle, colored it orange, duplicated it and placed both, one at the top left and the other at the bottom right.  </li>
    <li>Finally, I added another image resized to a large size to fill the flyer. I reduced its transparency to 10% and placed it behind the other features, to act as the background.  </li>
</ol>        </p>
